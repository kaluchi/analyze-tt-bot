# This is a dummy cookies file for TikTok video downloads
# 
# To use real cookies for TikTok authentication:
#
# 1. Export cookies from your browser using extensions:
#    - Chrome: \"Get cookies.txt LOCALLY\" extension
#    - Firefox: \"cookies.txt\" extension
#    - Edge: \"Get cookies.txt LOCALLY\" extension
#
# 2. Option A - Replace this file:
#    Copy your real cookies.txt content here, replacing these comments
#
# 3. Option B - Use environment variable (recommended):
#    Set YT_DLP_COOKIES_FILE to point to your real cookies file:
#    
#    Windows PowerShell:
#    $env:YT_DLP_COOKIES_FILE = \"C:\\path\	o\\your\\real_cookies.txt\"
#    
#    Windows CMD:
#    set YT_DLP_COOKIES_FILE=C:\\path\	o\\your\\real_cookies.txt
#    
#    Linux/macOS:
#    export YT_DLP_COOKIES_FILE=\"/path/to/your/real_cookies.txt\"
#
# 4. Cookie format (tab-separated values):
#    domain	flag	path	secure	expiration	name	value
#    .tiktok.com	TRUE	/	FALSE	1677649200	sessionid	your_session_here
#    .tiktok.com	TRUE	/	FALSE	1677649200	csrf_token	your_csrf_token_here
#
# Security notes:
# - Keep cookies files private (chmod 600 on Unix systems)
# - Rotate cookies regularly (monthly recommended)
# - Never commit real cookies to version control
# - Use different cookies for testing vs production
#
# This dummy file will be ignored by yt-dlp since it contains no valid cookie data.
# The bot will work without authentication but may encounter rate limits or geo-blocks.
