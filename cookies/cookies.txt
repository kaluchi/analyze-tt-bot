# Netscape HTTP Cookie File
# This is a dummy cookies file for TikTok Analyzer Bot
# 
# This file contains only instructions and will be ignored by yt-dlp.
# To enable TikTok cookies authentication, you have two options:
#
# OPTION 1: Use environment variable (recommended)
# Set YT_DLP_COOKIES_FILE to point to your real cookies file:
#   Windows: $env:YT_DLP_COOKIES_FILE = "C:\path\to\your\real_cookies.txt"
#   Linux:   export YT_DLP_COOKIES_FILE="/path/to/your/real_cookies.txt"
#   Docker:  YT_DLP_COOKIES_FILE=/host/path/cookies.txt docker-compose up
#
# OPTION 2: Replace this file
# Replace this dummy file with your real cookies file exported from browser
#
# HOW TO GET REAL COOKIES:
# 1. Install browser extension:
#    - Chrome: "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" extension
#    - Firefox: "cookies.txt" extension
#    - Edge: "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" extension
#
# 2. Visit tiktok.com and log in to your account
#
# 3. Use extension to export cookies in Netscape format
#
# 4. Save exported cookies to a file (e.g., my_tiktok_cookies.txt)
#
# 5. Set environment variable or replace this file
#
# SECURITY NOTES:
# - Never share your cookies file - it contains your login session
# - Rotate cookies every 30 days for security
# - Set file permissions to 600 (read/write owner only)
# - Keep cookies file outside of Git repository
#
# COOKIES FORMAT EXAMPLE (Netscape format):
# domain	flag	path	secure	expiration	name	value
# .tiktok.com	TRUE	/	FALSE	1677649200	sessionid	your_session_here
# .tiktok.com	TRUE	/	TRUE	1677649200	sid_tt	your_sid_value_here
#
# This dummy file will be ignored by yt-dlp as it contains only comments.
# Bot will work without authentication, but may have limited access to some videos.
